# Unleashing the Power of NFL Big Data: An Interactive Exploration:
#### The National Football League (NFL) is one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, with millions of fans tuning in each week to watch their favorite teams and players. But what goes on behind the scenes? How do coaches and players use data to gain an edge on the competition?

Final Project Part 3.1

Central Interactive Visualization: 
Our primary dataset will be the NFL Big Data set, which contains a wealth of information on player and team performance. Using this dataset, we will create an interactive visualization that allows users to explore player performance across different variables, such as speed, acceleration, and distance traveled. Users can select specific games or players to analyze, and the visualization will update in real-time to show how different variables impact performance.

Contextual Visualization #1: 
To provide a broader context for our analysis, we will include a chart showing the distribution of player positions across the league. This visualization will allow users to see how different positions are distributed and may help explain some of the trends we observe in our primary dataset.
